This repository contains code and data for modeling the amounts of claims related to the activity of a car insurance company. The modeling is performed using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) method, implemented in both Python and R programming languages.

Overview
Car insurance companies often need to estimate and predict the amounts of claims they are likely to receive based on various factors. This project aims to build a predictive model that can assist in understanding and forecasting claim amounts, utilizing data from an insurance provider.

Code 
Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the GLM method. It includes separate scripts for each step of the modeling process.
R code for data preprocessing, GLM model development, and evaluation. Similar to the Python directory, it includes individual scripts for different stages of the modeling pipeline.
